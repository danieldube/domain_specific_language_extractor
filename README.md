# Domain-Specific-Language-Extractor
This program extracts a domain specific language from C++ source Code.

## DSL Representation
The analyzer emits its findings as a human-readable Markdown report (with an optional JSON mirror) following the structure documented in [`docs/dsl_representation.md`](docs/dsl_representation.md). The report captures canonical terms, relationships between them, common workflows, and incoherence warnings so developers can quickly understand and refine the domain language used across the codebase.
